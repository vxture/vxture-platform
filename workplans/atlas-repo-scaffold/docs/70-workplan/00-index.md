# 70-workplan - Build plan and batch tracker

Atlas's repo-split plan. Authority: `vxture-platform` repo, plan file
`atlas-repo-split` (owner-approved 2026-07-24) - the seven phases below mirror
it. This tracker is the atlas-repo-local view; the platform-repo side (BFF
routers, seed-catalog, docs updates, old-code removal) is tracked there.

## Phase 1 - repo scaffold (this scaffold)

| Item                                                                                                        | Acceptance                                                                                                                                      | State                                                 |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Governance base (root files, secret hygiene, SCA gate, docs skeleton, guardrails)                           | `check-docs-numbering.mjs --strict` exit 0; `gitleaks detect` 0 hits; osv scan clean (with `--allow-no-lockfiles` until Phase 4 adds real deps) | scaffolded, unverified (needs a live repo + CI run)   |
| CI/CD workflows (`ci`/`build`/`deploy`/`db-init`/`rollback`/`secret-scan`/`codeql` + `tailnet-ssh-connect`) | workflows parse (`check-workflows.mjs --strict`); job names match the five required-check contexts                                              | scaffolded, unexercised                               |
| `deploy/database/ddl/{00_baseline,97_service_role,98_column_locks}.sql`                                     | `check-data-architecture.mjs --strict` (DDL <-> Prisma lockstep) once `service/prisma/schema.prisma` lands                                      | DDL written; Prisma lockstep unverified until Phase 4 |

## Phase 2 - data-layer migration (owner-gated live-DB work)

Migrate `model.*` (5 tables) out of the shared platform DB into this repo's
own physical database (`vxturestudio_modelruntime_main`), alongside the
already-designed `key`/`reqlog`/`routing` schemas. Replace the direct
cross-schema Prisma reads of `metering.quota_pools`/`usage_events`/
`usage_summary_months` with the standard C2/C3 network contract - this also
closes TD-002 (usage-metering no-op).

## Phase 3 - platform integration contract

OIDC RP five endpoints (present but inert - no browser surface today), C2
entitlement client, C3 provisioning webhook, C3 consume as the sole
inference-metering entry point, S2S provider surface (embedding/parse/rerank -
see TD-003 and the karda requirements letter) + S2S caller (upstream provider
adapters, carried over unchanged from the in-monorepo implementation).

## Phase 4 - extraction mechanics

`git filter-repo`/`subtree split` of `services/model/platform` from
vxture-platform, preserving history, merged into `service/` here. Own
Dockerfile (not the shared `Dockerfile.nestjs-prisma`, which assumes a
monorepo build context).

## Phase 5 - consumer network + auth cutover

`vxture-platform`'s `bff/admin-bff`/`bff/console-bff` and
`agent-server/varda`'s `model-runtime-client` switch from local/unauthenticated
calls to Atlas's real network address with S2S auth (closes TD-004).

## Phase 6 - platform-side registration

Deploy host assignment (TD-001, owner-gated), product catalog row completion,
webhook address, secret transport - see `docs/50-deployment/00-index.md`.

## Phase 7 - cutover and acceptance

Self-rectify runbook batches A-G all green; `product_200` section 7 six-item
e2e checklist (login -> provisioning -> gating -> consume -> invalidate
[skipped, atlas is not an asset-face product] -> full self-rectify one-shot);
real admin/console regression against the new network path; old
`services/model/platform` removed from vxture-platform only after the above.
