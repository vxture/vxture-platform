# 10-standards - Org standards (thin index)

This directory does NOT copy standard text. The org standards are authored and
versioned in the platform repo (`D:\MyWebSite\vxture`); every product repo
consumes them by reference so there is a single source of truth. Fix a gap in
the standard there first, then mirror it here - never invent a standard inside
a product repo.

## Template design and runbook (platform repo)

- `docs/30-design/product_240_repo-template.md` - what a product repo
  contains; section 3 (module x layer matrix) is the authority for exactly
  which modules apply to atlas as an L1 product (services profile, no
  business-plane DB baseline, no grant.invalidated/visible-set)
- `docs/50-deployment/rebuild/20-self-rectify-runbook.md` - batch A-G
  self-rectify runbook with per-step machine checks

## What this repo carries locally

The governance base is realized here as concrete artifacts, not prose: the
branch-protection ruleset (`docs/50-deployment/rebuild/main-ruleset.json`), the
secret-scan / SCA / docs-numbering guardrails, and the CI workflows. Those are
the enforcement; this index is the pointer to the WHAT they enforce.
