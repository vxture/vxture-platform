## Infra allocation (unassigned)

| Item           | Value                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Deploy host    | **unassigned** - see vxture-platform `docs/50-deployment/13-infra-allocation-registry.md` section 3, atlas row (all TBD as of this scaffold)                                                         |
| Stack root     | `/srv/md0/atlas` (placeholder, pending host assignment)                                                                                                                                              |
| Published port | `3100` (unchanged from the in-monorepo service)                                                                                                                                                      |
| Public domain  | `atlas.vxture.com` (reserved, not bound - Atlas is tailnet-only today; no edge vhost is scaffolded here, unlike karda, because Atlas currently has no browser-facing surface for a vhost to protect) |
| Tailnet        | class TBD, pending host assignment                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ACR namespace  | TBD (repo `vars.ALIYUN_ACR_NAMESPACE`, never hardcoded)                                                                                                                                              |

## GitHub bootstrap (one-time, not yet done)

1. `git init` -> establish `main` -> first push -> let CI run once (produces
   the five required check contexts) -> THEN apply
   `docs/50-deployment/rebuild/main-ruleset.json`. Applying the ruleset first
   blocks the initial import.
2. Create GitHub Environments: `production` (required reviewer) and, once a
   beta host exists, `beta` (no reviewer gate).
3. Populate secrets/vars per `.env.example` and the workflow files under
   `.github/workflows/` (`DEPLOY_HOST`/`DEPLOY_USER`/`DEPLOY_SSH_KEY`/
   `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS`/`DEPLOY_DIR`, `ALIYUN_ACR_*`, `TAILSCALE_OAUTH_*`,
   `NODE_AUTH_TOKEN`). Org-level shared credentials (ACR/tailscale/npm token)
   only need this repo added to the sharing allowlist, not rebuilt.
4. `DEPLOY_KNOWN_HOSTS` is mandatory (fail-closed in
   `.github/actions/tailnet-ssh-connect`) - collect via
   `ssh-keyscan -p <port> <host>` from a trusted network once the host exists.

## Platform-side registration (not yet done)

See the karda A/B-segment precedent (`vxture-platform` repo,
`docs/80-liaison/`) for the pattern: product catalog row, OIDC client, plan
skeleton, provisioning webhook address, secret transport - all owner-gated,
none of it agent-self-approved. As of this scaffold, the platform repo already
carries a partial head start for atlas (OIDC client descriptor, base-URL env
placeholders, product catalog row + 5-tier DRAFT plan skeleton) - see the
platform repo's `deploy/database/seed/seed-catalog.mjs` and
`docs/30-design/product_100_matrix.md` atlas row.

## Deploy pipeline

`deploy.yml` / `build.yml` / `rollback.yml` / `db-init.yml` and the
`tailnet-ssh-connect` composite action follow the org CD reference pattern
(vxture-arda). Authored but unexercised until the GitHub bootstrap and host
assignment above are done.
