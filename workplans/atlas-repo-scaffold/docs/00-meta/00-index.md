# 00-meta - Documentation map

Top-level index for this repository's `docs/`. The tree follows the org docs
taxonomy (`070-docs-taxonomy.md`) for the shared skeleton - ten decade-numbered
top directories, `00-index.md` in every directory, numbered files and
directories, numbered = formal / unnumbered = temporary.

How documents are numbered and organized INSIDE this repo is delegated to the
repo (taxonomy section 3): see **`10-docs-convention.md`** in this directory,
the local authority. The platform repo's `{kind}_{domain}_{NNN}_{slug}` domain
family is NOT used here - a single-domain repo separates by directory and
number band instead. The `lint:docs-numbering --strict` guardrail enforces the
convention (file names, directory names, root-only README whitelist) on every
push.

## Authority

This repo carries the org governance base as an extraction from vxture-platform
(product code `atlas`). The governing standards are NOT copied here; they live
in the platform repo (`D:\MyWebSite\vxture`):

- `docs/10-standards/140-repo-governance-standard.md` - governance base (WHAT)
- `docs/10-standards/070-docs-taxonomy.md` - docs numbering (shared skeleton;
  section 3 delegates in-repo organization to this repo)
- `docs/30-design/product_240_repo-template.md` - template design; section 3
  matrix defines exactly which modules apply to atlas as an L1 product (not
  the full app-profile set arda/karda/terra get)
- `docs/50-deployment/rebuild/20-self-rectify-runbook.md` - runbook (HOW + checks)

A `product_NNN_*` / `data_*` / `design_*` reference anywhere in this repo's docs
points at a PLATFORM-repo document, never a local one - local documents are
always `NN(N)-slug`.
