---

## A

**ADR (Architecture Decision Record)**
Architecture Decision Record. Documents the background, options, outcomes, and consequences of major technical decisions. Once Accepted, it is not modified; it can only be superseded by a new ADR. See `docs/decisions/`.

**Atlas**
Final product name (2026-07-06, `docs/design/product_100_matrix.md` v1.0) of the L1 model platform — the current model-platform service/domain. Sole host for all models (LLMs and specialized small models), sole LLM egress, and the single metering authority (all inference volume flows through Atlas → consume). Disambiguation: not the schema migration tool `ariga/atlas` referenced in `data_platform_320`.

**agent-server**
Private backend for an Agent. Runs the Tool Use Loop, invokes the LLM through model-platform, and persists sessions and messages. Each Agent instance has its own agent-server; cross-instance imports are prohibited.

**agent-studio**
Agent frontend (`agent-studio/*`). A Next.js application that renders the conversation UI. Different Agents use different deployment modes:

| Agent | Deployment Mode                       | Usage                                                                                                       |
| ----- | ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Varda | Embedded (iframe / module federation) | Embedded in console / admin as an assistant (sidebar, floating bar, full-screen)                            |
| Ruyin | Standalone deployment                 | Independent domain, super-agent; migration and vx-worker-02 deployment belong to `vxture/agentstudio-ruyin` |

**auth-bff**
The platform's sole JWT issuer (`@vxture/bff-auth`). Platform BFFs log in directly here and issue tokens; Business BFFs read the existing Cookie and redirect to console login when unauthorized. Other BFFs that need to issue tokens must delegate through `POST /auth/internal/sign`. See ADR-001.

---

## B

**BCP47**
IETF language tag standard (RFC 5646). This platform uses two tags: `zh-CN` (Simplified Chinese) and `en-US` (American English). They are used throughout URL route segments, the `<html lang>` attribute, `Intl.*` APIs, and translation file directories. See ADR-002.

**BFF (Backend For Frontend)**
Backend services tailored for specific frontends (`bff/*`). Classified by authentication mode into three categories: Platform BFF (with its own login page), Business BFF (reuses console Cookie), and functional BFF (auth / gateway). BFFs do not call LLMs directly; they must go through model-platform.

**business/**
Historical/candidate directory for scenario-specific business applications. After P7b, this repository no longer keeps the local Ruyin implementation; Ruyin has been migrated and deployed to vx-worker-02 by `vxture/agentstudio-ruyin`. Future vertical scenario applications should go into the corresponding external business repository.

---

## C

**CallerContext**
A strongly typed security context assembled by the BFF layer, encapsulating "who is making this request and what they are allowed to do," then passed to agent-server as trusted input. It is built from JWT claims + request headers and is **re-validated** in agent-server.

```typescript
interface CallerContext {
  surface: string; // Host portal context
  userId: string; // Authenticated user
  tenantId?: string; // Tenant-user specific
  allowedTools: string[]; // Whitelisted tools
  dataScope: "global" | "tenant"; // Data access boundary
}
```

Currently implemented in varda-bff → varda-server, and it is the common pattern for all Business BFFs. Do not override CallerContext with any field from the request body.

**core layer**
Infrastructure primitive layer (`packages/core/*`). Framework-agnostic (no NestJS, no Next.js), contains no business logic, and does not reference any upper-layer dependencies. Compatible with both Node.js and browsers (exception: `core-database` is server-side only).

---

## D

**dataScope**
The data access scope in CallerContext. `global`: operators can access all tenant data; `tenant`: tenant users can only access data belonging to their own tenant. agent-server tools must filter by this value during execution and must not bypass it.

**design-system**
UI component library and design tokens (`@vxture/design-system`). Applications must not bypass DS to create their own styles, components, or icons. Violations go through the audit process in `audit/checklist-ds.md`.

---

## G

**gateway-bff**
Browser-side API gateway (`@vxture/bff-gateway`, port 8000). Routes frontend requests to the corresponding dedicated BFF by path prefix. Zero business logic, zero authentication, zero aggregation.

---

## J

**jti (JWT ID)**
Unique JWT identifier (claim: `jti`). auth-bff generates it using `crypto.randomUUID()`. On logout, jti is written to the Redis blacklist (TTL = remaining access token lifetime) to implement stateful token revocation.

---

## M

**monorepo**
Single-repository, multi-package architecture. This project uses pnpm workspaces + Turborepo, with 35+ packages coexisting and locally linked via the `workspace:*` protocol, so packages can be referenced without publishing releases. See ADR-003.

---

## O

**operator**
Operator-side user type (JWT claim: `userType: "operator"`). Corresponds to `admin.vxture.com`, with `dataScope: global`, and can access all tenant data. Roles are system-configured (not hardcoded); several standard roles are preconfigured. See the admin package permission design for details.

---

## P

**product matrix (L0–L3)**
The platform's layered product structure, finalized 2026-07-06 (`docs/design/product_100_matrix.md` v1.0, names are final; doc family `product_{NNN}`, routing in its header): **L0** = the vxture platform itself (org/workspace/entitlement/metering/tool-protocol/sandbox; not a product, no product code); **L1** horizontal capability platforms = Atlas (models), Ontos (semantics), Runa (skills); **L2** object-domain platforms = Arda (structured data), Karda (unstructured knowledge), Terra (spatiotemporal/physical world); **L3** industry agents = Raven, Anlan, Forge, Xuanzhen. Outside the layers: Ruyin (client/desktop product, redefined), umbra (edge VPN at ruyin.ai, external), Hermes (internal). Sharing/isolation semantics: `docs/design/product_110_sharing-isolation.md` v1.0.

**platform-browser**
`@vxture/platform-browser`. Browser-side wrapper for third-party SDKs; currently the only implemented Platform SDK.

**PLG (Product-Led Growth)**
Product-led growth. The first social login automatically creates a Personal Tenant and grants Free Plan, enabling frictionless product entry without sales involvement. See ADR-005.

**portal**
Platform management UI (`portals/*`), including: `website` (official site), `admin` (operations console), and `console` (tenant console). Slow iteration pace, stable design.

**Prisma**
ORM tool. DDL is centralized in `@vxture/core-database` (currently 6 schema files, ⚠️ pending major refactor). `PrismaClient` instances are only used in service-layer repositories; direct database operations in BFFs or higher layers are prohibited.

---

## R

**RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)**
Role-based access control covering all platform permission management logic. Two completely isolated permission domains:

| Domain          | Corresponding Product      | Preconfigured Roles (configurable)                       |
| --------------- | -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| operator domain | admin (operations console) | Several standard roles, system-configured, not hardcoded |
| tenant domain   | console (tenant console)   | 3 categories: owner / admin / member                     |

See `docs/design/identity-platform-authorization.md`.

**refresh token**
Long-lived credential used to renew access tokens (default 7 days). Stored in Redis and deleted immediately on logout. Operators and tenants have separate Redis key prefixes (`refresh:operator:{userId}` vs `refresh:tenant:{surface}:{userId}`).

**ruyin**
Redefined 2026-07-06 (ADR-12): **Ruyin now names a client-side (desktop) product** (product definition pending; not in the workspace×product entitlement engine; interoperates only at the Atlas/Runa layer). The product previously called "ruyin" — the external integration at domain `ruyin.ai`, maintained in `vxture/agentstudio-ruyin` (worker-04 stack) — is now named **umbra** (see entry). The domain `ruyin.ai` and the existing OIDC RP contract (`docs/design/identity-platform-ruyin-contract.md`) are unchanged and remain valid for umbra.

---

## S

**service layer**
Domain business logic layer (`services/*/*`), grouped by domain: `ai`, `identity`, `notification`, `commerce`, `support`. NestJS modules, with Prisma in the repository sublayer. Direct cross-service imports are prohibited; cross-service calls must go through HTTP.

**shared layer**
Pure utility layer (`@vxture/shared`). Pure TypeScript, with no framework or Node.js/browser API dependencies, shared across the platform. Must not reference any internal packages.

**SharingGrant**
Org-internal sharing authorization object (`docs/design/product_110_sharing-isolation.md` v1.0 §8, ADR-12): resource (dataset / knowledge base / skill, owned by org×ws×product) × grantee (workspace | product | org-all) × scope (parameterized per resource type: read / retrieve / apply / use) × status/expires. Default-deny; sharing never copies data; enforced at retrieval level at each asset-plane (L2) entry; combined evaluation = grant ∧ entitlement. Policy SoT lives in the platform control plane `sharing` schema (design line `data_sharing_100/200`, pending). Cross-tenant supply uses entitlement (P-level assets), never grants.

**SSE (Server-Sent Events)**
Browser one-way push protocol based on long-lived HTTP connections. Agent streaming responses are implemented via SSE: `agent-server → BFF → browser`. The frontend consumes it with `EventSource` or `fetch streaming`.

**surface**
Context identifier for the Agent host portal, passed via HTTP Header `X-{Agent}-Surface`, and used together with JWT `userType` to determine `dataScope` and `allowedTools`.

Current values:

| Value     | Meaning                                   | Corresponding User Type |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| `admin`   | Operations management side (admin portal) | operator                |
| `console` | Tenant control side (console portal)      | tenant_user             |

> ⚠️ Planned: surface will be split into two layers. The `admin` domain will be split into an operations management subdomain + a platform self-governance subdomain; the `console` domain will be split into a management subdomain + an application subdomain. The naming scheme (whether `admin` will be renamed to `ops`, etc.) will be determined in the next version design.

---

## T

**Tailscale**
Zero-configuration VPN mesh. The `vxture` repository currently only maintains the GitHub Actions deployment channel to VXTURE_DEPLOY_HOST, as well as the external contracts for platform auth-bff / SSO / model-platform against. Business worker internal network calls are maintained by external business repositories.

**tenant**
Data boundary for multi-tenant isolation. Each tenant_user belongs to at least one tenant and may belong to multiple tenants. Current authoritative model is the four-layer structure **User → Tenant (personal/organization) → Workspace → two-level Membership** (`data_platform_100_architecture.md` §3.4; ADR-11): the tenant/org is the **absolute isolation boundary and billing/settlement subject**; the **workspace** is the subscription/entitlement/isolation subject. Plan tiers are per-product 5 levels (free → starter → pro → business → enterprise, ADR-11); the older Free/Pro/Enterprise 3-tier table is obsolete.

**tenant_user**
Tenant-side user type (JWT claim: `userType: "tenant_user"`). Corresponds to `console.vxture.com` and Agent products, with `dataScope: tenant`, and can only access data belonging to their own tenant.

**Tool Use Loop**
AI Agent reasoning loop: LLM decides to call a tool → tool executes → result returns to LLM → continue or terminate. Implemented in agent-server. All LLM calls **must go through model-platform** (unified billing, quota, and authorization control); directly importing provider SDKs (Anthropic / Doubao, etc.) is prohibited, otherwise control is bypassed and metering/auditing become impossible.

**ToolRegistry**
Agent tool whitelist registry (`agent-server/*/tools/tool-registry.ts`). Tools must be whitelist-validated before execution; `allowedTools` comes from CallerContext, not accepted from the frontend.

---

## U

**umbra**
Edge VPN product at domain `ruyin.ai` (external repository, worker-04 stack; read-only write boundary for this repo). It is the actual counterparty of the OIDC RP contract formerly labeled "ruyin" (`identity-platform-ruyin-contract.md`, still valid; **client_id switched to `umbra` on 2026-07-07** — one-shot rename per `docs/design/product_300_naming-migration.md` §2 v1.1, executed and verified; the freed `ruyin` client_id now belongs to the client-side product's web RP at `ruyin.vxture.com`). Keeps its current tenant-level subscription mode; exempt from the workspace×product entitlement engine and excluded from the sharing/isolation model (ADR-12 D7).

---

## V

**varda**
Embedded intelligent assistant (`agent-studio/varda`, @vxture/agent-studio-varda). Embedded micro-frontend loaded into admin and console, providing conversation UI + Tool Use feedback display (sidebar / floating bar / full-screen). Three ends: `agent-studio/varda` + `agent-server/varda` + `bff/varda-bff`. Future migration target is `vxture/agentstudio-varda`, but planning must wait until Ruyin in `vxture/agentstudio-ruyin` completes business workflow templates.

---

## W

**workspace**
Isolation and commerce subject under a tenant/org (four-layer model: User → Tenant → **Workspace** → two-level Membership). Holds subscriptions, entitlements, quota pools, and bills (cost center; the org is the billing account) — ADR-11. `workspace_id` is the authoritative business-plane isolation key: every product's agent-db isolates data by it (issued by the platform entitlement system, never self-declared by products). Also the org-internal sharing unit for SharingGrant. Note: legacy code paths and `CallerContext` still carry only `tenantId`; workspace propagation is part of the integration target state (`docs/design/product_200_integration.md`).

---

## @

**@layer**
Annotation in a code file header declaring its architectural layer (e.g., `@layer Application`). It is a required file header field (see `docs/ai/03-coding-comments.md`), and is also the basis for AI agents to judge file responsibility boundaries.

---

## AI Infrastructure

**model-platform**
Unified AI model access layer (`@vxture/service-model-platform`). Final product name: **Atlas** (see entry; service/package rename is a registered follow-up). This is a platform capability, currently deployed with the VXTURE_DEPLOY_HOST platform stack. If resource or isolation requirements increase in the future, it will move to an independent platform AI node and will not be deployed to business workers such as vx-worker-02/03/04/05. It is the sole entry point for all LLM calls and is responsible for: model routing, billing metering, quota control, and Provider abstraction (currently integrated: Doubao; extensible: Anthropic, etc.). agent-server / business services call model-platform through controlled HTTP/API, and must not bypass it to connect directly to providers. Business workers must not hold platform Provider Keys.
