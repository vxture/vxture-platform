/**
 * health.utils.ts - Service health / identity endpoint contract helper
 * @package @vxture/shared
 * @description Single source for the health-endpoint identity block defined by
 *   docs/10-standards/025-service-health-endpoint-contract.md. Every liveness
 *   endpoint (Next `/api/health`, NestJS `/healthz`, …) builds its response
 *   from here so field names, provenance sourcing, and honest fallbacks stay
 *   uniform across services and repos. Provenance is injected at build time as
 *   ENV (APP_VERSION / GIT_SHA / BUILD_TIME / DEPLOY_STAGE); when absent, values
 *   fall back to honest placeholders ("dev" / "unknown") — never hardcode.
