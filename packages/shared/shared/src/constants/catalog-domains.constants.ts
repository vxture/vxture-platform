 * catalog-domains.constants.ts — the platform's value-domain CONTRACT

 *
 * The DB CHECK constraints, seed, in-repo services, and external products
 * CONFORM to these. This file never derives an alias or a compat value to
 * accommodate a non-conforming product — if something doesn't match, that
 * thing is fixed to match here. tier is exactly five; a product that wants a
 * sixth is not supported and corrects itself.
 *
 * Pure value sets + types. ZERO business logic: which status grants coverage,
 * how to project/aggregate, how tiers rank — all live in the owning domain
 * (subscription service / entitlement engine), reading these values.
 *
 * DB sync is enforced by scripts/guardrails/check-catalog-domains.mjs.
