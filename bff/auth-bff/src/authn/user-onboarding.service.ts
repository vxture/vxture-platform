/**
 * user-onboarding.service.ts — the SINGLE consolidation point for everything
 * that must accompany a user account (owner directive 2026-07-06: one file that
 * lists every association/initialization so the set is inspectable and
 * extensible).
 *
 * ══ First-user checklist (what a complete user looks like) ═══════════════════
 *
 *  Inside AccountService.createUser's transaction (identity core, atomic):
 *    1. account.users          — user_no from sequence; account defaults to
 *                                `_{user_no}`; phone = verified anchor.
 *    2. account.user_profiles  — 1:1 display row (display_name from input /
 *                                federated profile name).
 *    3. credential.user_credentials — only when a password was supplied.
 *    4. loyalty.user_points    — zero-balance growth row (D-growth baseline).
 *
 *  Social-login extras (social-auth.service, before/after createUser):
 *    5. identity.identities    — federated binding (provider, subject) UNIQUE.
 *    6. account.user_avatars   — imported provider avatar (new users only).
 *
 *  Here (this service; separate idempotent transactions):
 *    7. tenancy.tenants        — personal org, auto-provisioned once per user
 *                                (partial unique index enforces ≤1 personal).
 *                                Naming rule (owner 2026-07-06):
 *                                display_name > account(username) > user_no —
 *                                resolved in-repo when no explicit name is given.
 *    8. tenancy.workspaces     — default workspace, name 'workspace',
 *                                is_default=true (user-renamable later).
 *    9. tenant/workspace_memberships — owner role at both scopes (composite
 *                                FK pins role scope).
 *   10. loyalty.user_points    — healed here too (ensure) for accounts created
 *                                before step 4 existed.
 *
 *  Extension points (registered, not yet built):
 *    - invite-code / referral attribution + rewards (voucher/extension coupon +
 *      points, composable) — docs/product/platform/feature-backlog.md
 *    - welcome notification / first-login guide flags
 *
 * `ensureOnboarded` is called from the shared tenant-login tail
 * (oidc.finishTenantLogin), so ANY interactive login self-heals a user who is
 * missing pieces 7–10 (PLG lazy provisioning + backfill in one place).
