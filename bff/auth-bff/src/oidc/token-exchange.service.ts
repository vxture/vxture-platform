/**
 * token-exchange.service.ts — RFC 8693 token exchange grant (T1, product_210 §3).
 *
 * Mints short-lived S2S tokens for product↔product calls, replacing
 * `AUTH_INTERNAL_TOKEN` as the long-term direction (product_210 §1/§5).
 * Two modes (product_210 §3.2):
 *  - OBO (on-behalf-of): the caller presents a `subject_token` — a real user
 *    access_token this IdP issued. Context (org/workspace/sub) is read from
 *    that token, not trusted from the request body — the caller cannot forge
 *    a workspace it has no user session in.
 *  - service: no subject_token; the caller declares `workspace_id` (+ optional
 *    `org_id`) explicitly. D2 gates minting on the caller product holding real
 *    coverage of that workspace (active/trialing subscription OR a provisioned
 *    state) — "you can only speak for a workspace you're actually opened in".
 *
 * Claims follow product_210 §3.1 exactly: `aud` = target product_code (single
 * value), `act.sub` = caller product_code, `org_id`/`workspace_id`, `mode`,
 * `scope = tool:{target}` (product-level, D3). `sub` is present only in OBO
 * mode (service-mode tokens have no user behind them). TTL = 300s,
 * not-refreshable (D1) — the caller re-exchanges on expiry.
 *
 * The provider (被调方) verification obligations (§3.3: RS256-only, kid
 * lookup, iss/aud/exp/act.sub checks, never accept AUTH_INTERNAL_TOKEN for
 * this) are NOT this file's concern — they land wherever a tool endpoint
 * verifies inbound S2S tokens: per-provider for T3, and — for the platform's
 * own `/platform/*`/`/usage/*` endpoints — `PlatformAuthGuard` (T2, scoped
 * to those three routers only — NOT `InternalAuthGuard`, which protects
 * operator/account admin-internal routers and must never accept this
 * grant's tokens), which accepts `aud = PLATFORM_S2S_AUDIENCE` tokens
 * minted by this same grant.
