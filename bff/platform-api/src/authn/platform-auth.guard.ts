/**
 * platform-auth.guard.ts — the platform-face C2/C3 self-service guard.
 * @package @vxture/bff-platform-api
 *
 * Protects ONLY the three platform-face self-service endpoints (T2,
 * product_210 §3.5/§8): `platform-entitlements.router.ts`,
 * `platform-usage.router.ts`, `platform-sharing.router.ts`. Deliberately
 * a SEPARATE class from auth-bff's `InternalAuthGuard` (post-review split,
 * 2026-07-12) — that guard also gates operator/account admin actions that
 * trust a caller-declared actor id with no identity binding, and must never
 * accept a bearer credential any confidential OIDC client can mint for
 * itself. This guard's blast radius is scoped to exactly the three routers
 * that were designed to be product self-service in the first place.
 *
 * Two accepted credentials, either satisfies (migration, not a breaking
 * cutover — live callers like arda that haven't adopted token exchange yet
 * are unaffected):
 *
 *  - legacy: the shared AUTH_INTERNAL_TOKEN in `x-vxture-internal-auth`.
 *    Fail-closed when the token is unconfigured; constant-time compare.
 *  - S2S token (new): `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, a token minted by
 *    the token-exchange grant (T1) with `aud = PLATFORM_S2S_AUDIENCE`.
 *    Verified via S2sTokenVerifier (IdP JWKS over the internal network —
 *    D13 host split: the signing private key stays confined to auth-bff);
 *    `act.sub` (rule 6, §3.3) must be present and becomes the caller's
 *    product identity, attached to the request as `s2sCaller` for handlers
 *    to read via the `@S2sCaller()` decorator.
 *
 * `AUTH_INTERNAL_TOKEN` retirement (the "退役" end state) is NOT this
 * change — see TD-035/product_210 §8 T2 for the residual gap this dual-
 * accept mode does not close: neither path binds the caller's identity to
 * the specific workspace/product it asks about in the request body/query
 * (pre-existing, applies to both credentials equally).
